- **Pascal Case:** Use Pascal case for class names, method names, and property names.

    ```
    public class MyClass
    {
        public void MyMethod()
        {
            // Code here
        }

        public int MyProperty { get; set; }
    }
    ```

#### 5.1.3 Language Features

- **Expression-bodied Members:** Utilize expression-bodied members for concise one-liners.

    ```
    // Good
    public int CalculateSquare(int x) => x * x;

    // Bad
    public int CalculateSquare(int x)
    {
        return x * x;
    }
    ```

- **Null Conditional Operator:** Use the null conditional operator (`?.`) for safe property or method access.

    ```
    // Good
    int? length = text?.Length;

    // Bad
    int length = (text != null) ? text.Length : 0;
    ```
